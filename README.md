# Web-Market
Avito-styled open market website

This is a rep for our educational project in system and software engineering class. This website purposed to give people a simple and clear platform, where they can buy/sell their new or used things. This site wil have searching by categories and characteristics, rating system for all selers and order system.

We wil use increment model (which is a very good fit for github version control system) and kanban metodology.
Directly for development we will use React for front and Django for back.
